# `Textile` Extension

Textile is one of the markup languages supported by Awestruct. This extension doesn't add support for textile, but rather extends the behavior of Textile itself.

The implementation that Awestruct uses is RedCloth. It's possible to customize Textile using RedCloth in two ways:

* Define block tags
* Filter inline markup

Let's look at the two cases.

## Define block tags

To define block tags, you simply add an Awestruct extension that overrides the RedCloth HTML formatter. Here's an example of how to define a custom tag for vimeo:

    module RedCloth::Formatters::HTML
      def vimeo(opts)
        clip_id, dim = opts[:text].split(' ').map! {|s| s.strip}
        dim_attrs = ''
        if dim
          # x is transformed by &#215; by textile
          w, h = dim.split('&#215;')
        else
          w, h = ["800", "600"]
        end
        dim_attrs = " width=\"\#{w}\" height=\"\#{h}\""
        "<iframe\#{pba(opts)}\#{dim_attrs} src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/\#{clip_id}?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>"
      end
    end

You need to require the file with this code in _ext/pipeline.rb.

## Filter inline markup

Markup is filtered using rule methods. Custom rule methods are passed to the `to_html` method of the RedCloth object. Awestruct will read in the method names defined by `site.textile_rules`, convert them to symbols (if they aren't already), and pass them to this method.

The functions must be included into the RedCloth class using an Awestruct Extension. For example:

    module Awestruct::Extensions
      class TextilePlus
        def initialize()
          RedCloth.send(:include, CustomRules)
        end
    
        module CustomRules
          def emoticons(text)
             # replace emoticons in text
          end
        end
      end
    end

You can either set site.textile_rules inside the extension, or in _config/site.yml. Here's an example of using site.yml (where the methods are defined as strings):

    textile_rules = [emoticons]

Here's an example of registering them in the extension (where the methods are defined as symbols):

    def execute(site)
      site.textile_rules = [:emoticons]
    end

You then initialize the extension in your pipeline:

    extension Awestruct::Extensions::TextilePlus.new() 

Now you can use your custom markup and tags.
