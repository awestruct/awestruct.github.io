= Site deployment
:page-layout: default
:page-show_header: true

Awestruct provides several automated options to deploy your site, which makes publishing online easy!

Using Awestruct, you can deploy your site to any of these destinations:

. https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages]
. an arbitrary server using +rsync+ and +ssh+
. https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon S3]

You use link:/profiles[site profiles], to configure your deployment.
Once you're configured, deploying is just a single command.

 $ awestruct -P production --deploy

== Configuration

In your +_config/site.yml+, you should define a +profiles+ block, and a profile for each deployment environment.
The names are arbitrary.

[source,yaml]
--
profiles:
  development:
  staging:
  production:
--

Awestruct can gzip the contents of your html, css and javascript files, before deploying.
This can be usefull to avoid extra CPU usage on your server.

[source,yaml]
--
profiles:
  development:
  staging:
  production:
    deploy:
      gzip: true
--

By default, Awestruct will use the highest compression level.
You can change the compression level by adding the +gzip_level+.
The value must be between 1 (low compression) and 9 (high compression).

[source,yaml]
--
profiles:
  development:
  staging:
  production:
    deploy:
      gzip: true
      gzip_level: 5
--

WARNING: Help! Awestruct keeps complaining that I have uncommitted changes when deploying

Awestruct deployments will fail if you have uncommitted changes in your git local history.
While this is fine for most, there are occasions when you may wish to deploy to a stagging site to inspect your changes without adding a commit. 
Simply add +uncommitted: true+ to your deploy config.

[source,yaml]
--
profiles:
  development:
  staging:
    deploy:
      uncommitted: true
  production:
--

== GitHub Pages 

To deploy your site to GitHub pages,
you will need to be using http://github.com[GitHub] as a source repository for the site you want to publish.

NOTE: To enable GitHub Pages deployment,
set +host+ to +github_pages+ and set the +base_url+ to the github pages URL.

The +base_url+ can be your own domain if you set it up correctly in GitHub. 
In this example, it's just the default domain that GitHub provides.

[source,yaml]
--
profiles: 
  production: 
    base_url: http://awestruct.github.com/github_pages 
    deploy: 
      host: github_pages 
--

This will publish your site to the default +gh-pages+ branch, used by GitHub for site publication.
To publish to the master branch, add +branch: master+ to your deployment configuration.

[source,yaml]
--
profiles: 
  production: 
    base_url: http://awestruct.github.com/github_pages 
    deploy: 
      host: github_pages 
      branch: master
--

== Amazon S3

If you host your site on Amazon S3, you can also deploy to different buckets for each of your profiles.

NOTE: To enable Amazon S3 deployment,
set +type+ to +s3+ and set +bucket+ to the S3 bucket URL (that starts with +s3://+).

[source,yaml]
--
profiles:
  development:
  staging:
    deploy:
      type: s3
      bucket: s3://staging.example.com
    production:
      deploy:
      type: s3
      bucket: s3://example.com
--

NOTE: Wait, what command are you actually using? 

The deployment to Amazon S3 is using the ruby-s3cmd gem and the executed command looks like

 $ s3cmd sync _site/ $S3_BUCKET

== Rsync and SSH

Rsync and SSH require a little more configuration than GitHub pages, but in general, this is the more flexible option. 
Before deploying, make sure you have your public and private SSH keys setup on your server and local system before deploying.

NOTE: To enable +rsync+ deployment,
set +host+ and +path+ to specify where the resulting site should be copied to.
Also make sure that +base_url+ is set correctly for each profile.

[source,yaml]
--
profiles:
  development:
  staging:
    base_url: https://staging.example.com
    deploy:
      host: example.com
      path: /var/www/domains/staging.example.com/staging/htdocs/ 
    production:
      base_url: https://example.com
      deploy:
        host: example.com
        path: /var/www/domains/example.com/www/htdocs/ 
--

NOTE: Wait, what command are you actually using?

The +rsync+ command executed looks like

 $ rsync -rv --delete _site/ $HOST:$PATH
