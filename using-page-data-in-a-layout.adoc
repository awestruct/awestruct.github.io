Often times you may need to use information from a page inside of a layout.
A common usecase are javascript files particular to a page.
You can use the `page` variable within any layout to access any data particular to a page.

Using the JavaScript example if you wanted to add scripts to a layout, the easiest thing to do would be to add the script URLs to the front_matter of the page:

.page.md
----
---
title: My Page
scripts: [http://.../blah.js, http://.../bar.js]
---

Page content
----

._layouts/base.slim
----
...
  - page.front_matter.scripts.each do |url|
    script href=url
----

You may have other sections or variables on a page that you need, but this is the basics.
If you need something in a page or layout, the easiest way to do this is to add it to the front-matter of the page.
