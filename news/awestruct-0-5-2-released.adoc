We're on a roll with Awestruct: 0.5.2! 

This was mainly a bug fix release again, however, we did slip in a few small improvements. 
You can see the full log at {milestone-url}[Milestone 0.5.2].
For those interested in the actual commit history, it can be found at {commit-history-url}[GitHub].
Here are the list of bug fixes:

* Fixing the missing bootstrap-affix.js file, done by upgrading the bootstrap-sass version
* git is no longer required for deployment unless it's checking for uncommitted changes
* Version range of dependencies is better. We many have swung too far on this, let us know.
* asciidoctor tests have been fixed
* Returning 404 pages if the requested index page cannot be found

The smaller list of improvements:

* Adding a default Gemfile on init
* You can exclude paths from the `Indexifier` extension based on a regexp
* minification is less chatty
