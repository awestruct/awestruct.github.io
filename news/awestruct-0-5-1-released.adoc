The main fixes (and one enhancement) are detailed below:

== Foundation Support

Foundation is another CSS framework similar to 960, blueprint, or Twitter Bootstrap.
It be use at the start of project creation:

 $ awestruct -i -f foundation

== Automated Build and Deploy

I'd like to highlight a new documentation section that was added between the 0.5.0 and this release: http://awestruct.github.io/auto-deploy-to-github-pages/[Automated deployment to GitHub Pages] by Dan Allen.
This documents how to easily get a site up and running and published on GitHub pages, but it doesn't stop there!
Dan demonstrates how to use https://travis-ci.com/[Travis] to do automatic site deployment on git commit! 
It's never been easier to publish an Awestruct site.

== Thanks!

Thanks to https://github.com/awestruct/awestruct/contributors[everyone who has contributed to Awestruct] and those of you who use it, help others to use it and/or evangelize the technology.
We're honored to have you as part of the community!

Now go create awesome sites!
