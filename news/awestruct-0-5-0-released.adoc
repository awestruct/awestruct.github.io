We're thrilled to announce the release of Awestruct 0.5.0!

Awestruct 0.5.0 marks a significant evolution in the history of the project.
The focus of this release has been on *ease of installation*, *compatibility* and *flexibility*.

The major highlights of this release are:

* Integration of https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt[Tilt] to handle rendering
* Cut dependencies in half (from 22 down to 11)
* Improved compatibility with JRuby
* Tight AsciiDoc integration using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]
* An Amazon S3 deployer
* Switched to Ruby's Logger class to output messages

This release is an important step towards achieving Awestruct's primary goal: to make static websites trivially easy to create 'and publish'.
We hope when you try it, you'll agree.

== Setup and migration

Awestruct is bundled as Ruby gem and published to http://rubygems.org/gems/awestruct[rubygems.org].
You can install it using:

 $ gem install awestruct

If this is your first time using Awestruct, you can create a new website based on http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap[Bootstrap] by running the following command inside an empty directory:

 $ awestruct -i -f bootstrap

The setup command now adds a rake build file, +Rakefile+, to the project.
It's optional, but it does make running Awestruct a little bit easier and gets your contributors setup quicker.
More on that in a bit.

If you're already using Awestruct to bake your website, we *strongly* recommend that you follow the {migration-guide}[migration guide] to upgrade to this new version.

== What's new?

With this release, the version of Awestruct jumped from 0.4.8 to 0.5.0.
The changes described below should help explain why we decided to skip a version.

=== Tilt integration

The most significant change in 0.5.0 is the integration of https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt[Tilt], a generic interface to numerous template engines in Ruby.
Tilt is now used to render any file written in https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt#tilt--[any template language it supports].

Here are some of the benefits of using Tilt:

* As soon Tilt adds support for another template language, it's available for use with Awestruct
* Tilt lets you to select between different engines for a given markup language (such as Markdown)
* You can configure all the template engines from one place, +_config/site.yml+

=== Less dependencies

Not only did the switch to Tilt simplify the rendering code in Awestruct, it also cut down on the number of Awestruct's hard dependencies. 
Tilt loads the libraries required to render a template language when they are needed.
Therefore, if you don't have any Textile files in your project, you don't need RedCloth--the Textile implementation in Ruby--installed.

Some of Awestruct's built-in extensions were requiring additional libraries.
These extensions are now disabled if the library is not available.
As a result, you may notice warnings when you start Awestruct, like:

 WARNING: Missing required dependency to activate optional built in extension
 coffeescripttransform.rb -> cannot load such file -- coffee-script

However, the warning message is a better alternative than requiring you to install libraries you don't need :)

*In all, the number of dependencies has been trimmed from 22 down to 11.*

The trade-off of trimming Awestruct's dependencies is that you need to explicitly install libraries required to use any template language or built-in Awestruct extension you want to use (and add them to your Gemfile, if you're using Bundler).

See the {migration-guide}[migration guide] for a list of libraries you'll likely need to install.

'...in case you were wondering, you *no longer* have to install less, therubyracer or v8 to use Awestruct ;)'

=== Ruby compatibility

Each change to Awestruct is now tested on the latest release of all major versions of Ruby (1.8.7, 1.9.3, 2.0.0 and JRuby 1.7.3).
Awestruct is also battle tested across multiple platforms (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows).

We're happy to say Awestruct has finally reached stability when running across all platforms.
If issues still remain, we're eager to hear about them and get them resolved.

=== AsciiDoc integration

With AsciiDoc, we're exploring a deeper integration between Awestruct and the content pages, specifically a bidirectional exchange of data.

Instead of adding the typical Awestruct front matter to the top of the document, you can define the front matter using attributes in the AsciiDoc header.
Awestruct will also map the AsciiDoc title, author and date to the matching front matter attributes.
You can also refer to Awestruct page variables using AsciiDoc attribute references.

The source of this blog entry serves as an example of this integration:

In other words, an AsciiDoc document can be used in an Awestruct site without any modifications (except for the addition of the +:awestruct-layout:+ attribute).

=== Amazon S3 deployer

In addition to the rsync and GitHub Pages deployers, Awestruct can now deploy a site to Amazon S3.
For instructions on how to set it up, see the http://awestruct.org/deployment[site deployment] page on the Awestruct website.

=== Rakefile

Awestruct now adds a http://rake.rubyforge.org[Rake] build file, +Rakefile+, to new sites by default.
The purpose of this build file is to simplify setting up and using Awestruct across the numerous Ruby platforms.
_It's not required to use Awestruct_, though it does save you time (hopefully).

Now, instead of typing:

 $ awestruct -d

you just type:

 $ rake

While that may only save a few characters, know that it also auto-detects a Bundler environment and does the right thing.
That means if you're using Bundler, instead of typing:

 $ bundle exec awestruct -d

you just type:

 $ rake

See, isn't that nicer?

It also tells you what commands to type to setup an Awestruct environment (as contributors might need to do).

For more details, read the comments at the top of the https://github.com/awestruct/awestruct/blob/master/lib/awestruct/frameworks/base_Rakefile[Rakefile].

If you don't want to use rake, just ignore or delete the file.

=== Bootstrap upgrade

Many of you who use Awestruct have probably taken advantage of the Bootstrap integration via https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass[bootstrap-sass].
If you have, note that Awestruct has upgraded to Bootstrap 2.3.0, the latest version of Bootstrap that bootstrap-sass supports at the time of this release.
Since Awestruct has a transitive dependency on this library, it gets upgraded when you upgrade Awestruct.

If you want to keep using an older version of Bootstrap, just declare the version explicitly in your Gemfile.

That about wraps it up.
For more details about what's in this release, see the {migration-guide}[migration guide] or just http://awestruct.org/getting_started[try it for yourself].

== Thanks!

Many people rallied together to make this release easier to install, more compatible and more flexible.
Without their help, Awestruct wouldn't be where it is today.
